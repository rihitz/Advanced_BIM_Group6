# Assignment 4 - Group 6
For the final assignment in the course of Advanced Building Information Modelling, we encourage you to take part in our collaborative learning initiative. To facilitate this, we, Group 6, have prepared a short introduction to our tools along with a comprehensive video tutorial.

## Use case:
The BIM tools created for this course are best utilized alongside each other. Their primary objective is to enhance the provided IFC model by incorporating properties typically associated with architectural IFC models, with a specific focus on material types ([Tool A3](https://github.com/rihitz/Advanced_BIM_Group6/tree/main/A3:%20OpenBIM%20Change)) and consequently perform quantity takeoff ([Tool A2](https://github.com/rihitz/Advanced_BIM_Group6/tree/main/A2:%20Analysis)).

As a result the primary use case for this joined BIM tool is project cost estimation, with a specific focus on structural elements - columns, load bearing walls, beams and slabs. The main objective is to streamline the process of precise quantity takeoffs, provided that an IFC model of an appropriate development level is available. This tool aims to improve the decision making and accuracy in cost estimation for construction projects.
It can be used by all stakeholders involved in construction projects, especially those interested in the structural aspects. Designers can quickly compare various design concepts in terms of projected expenses, facilitating quick and informed decision making. Contractors, on the other hand, can efficiently estimate material costs for any given project. Furthermore, this tool has the potential to contribute in Life Cycle Assessment analysis.

## Jupyter Notebooks:
For a narrated and interactive learning experience, feel free to explore our Juypiter Notebooks, that cover the entire functionality of both tools:

[Notebook A3](https://github.com/rihitz/Advanced_BIM_Group6/blob/main/A4%3A%20OpenBIM%20Champion/A3.ipynb) 

**NOTE:** If you plan to execute the tool on your own machine, ensure proper handling of dependencies by saving and opening the .ipynb file in the tool's dedicated root directory.
