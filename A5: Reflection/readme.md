# Assignment 5 - Group 6

## Our learning experience  
At the beginning of the ccourse, we considered ourselves to be complete beginners in Advanced BIM, mainly familiar with basic 3D modelling. Prior to this, we had never looked into more complex OpenBIM concepts introduced in the course. Throughout, the learning journey has been valuable, mainly driven by self-development, exploration and hands-on practice.
Now, having progressed through the course, we feel we've ascended the OpenBIM learning curve to the "Self Learner" level. We believe we've acquired foundational knowledge that should allow us to move forward through continuous self-improvement and deeper study of the subject.

The biggest challenge throughout this course, admitedly has been directly tied to our competency in Python programming. The OpenBIM concepts are rather complicated on their own, but bringing in an intermediate level programming that comes with it, in our opinion, increased the dificulty exponentially, especially without having solid background or prior experience. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the BIM standard ISO 19650 would contribute to a clearer comprehension of the entire hierarchy involved in constructing an IFC model accordingly.

## Our process of developing the tutorial  
The course and its assignments allowed us to formulate our own research questiosn and work on solving them, which directly involved learning and applying new OpenBIM concepts. While it's great to have the flexibility to choose project topics based on our interests, we believe, it also adds a considerable level of complexity to organizing the course. Handling diverse ideas students may have come up with makes it challenging to provide suitable examples for all, which, in our opinion, negatively impacts the overall learning experience of OpenBIM concepts for students.

As we see it, the number of tools required and developed during this course was reasonable. However, personally, we would have preferred working on a single tool throughout the entire course, which could potentially allow for a more concentrated study on specific OpenBIM concepts and thus provide a better understanding of the applied methodology. We believe that such approach could have enabled us to properly finalize the first tool instead of just conceptualizing what the tool "could have been" through a BPMN diagram. On the other hand, given our lack of competency in programming, this seems like a reasonable solution.

## Feedback we received  
The received feedback overall was highly positive, with acknowledgment that our use case was clearly adressed and well defined. The tool appeared to effectively deal with the identified use case, by defining a clear goal and delivering on it. Our approach was deemed clear and understandable. 

Our Peer-review mentioned the need to revisit the tutorial due to a learning curve, especially for those not familiar with the utilized concepts. Generally, it was concluded that a deeper look and script examination should be carried out to gain a better perspective on the overall structure of the tool. However, despite this learning curve, the model was generally considered clear, understandable and appeared easy to implement.

The project scope was deemed clear and comprehensive, covering everything effectively. There was a suggestion to further explore the aspect of LCA analysis, which was seen as potentially interesting and also briefly mentioned in our tool's presentation.

## Our future with Advanced BIM  
Considering that our thesis topics are already fixed and not closely related to OpenBIM, it seems unlikely that we'll directly apply the concepts learned in this course. This holds true to some extent for our professional careers as well, given that our individual interests and focus areas are less aligned with the advanced aspects of OpenBIM. However, we recognize the constantly evolving landscape of the AEC industry and appreciate the insights and knowledge acquired from this course, which could prove valuable in the near future.

## Conclusions  
In summary, the course provided a highly flexible learning experience by allowing us the freedom to choose the direction of our individual project work. This, as stated before, has its advantages and disadvantages. The itroduction of intermediate level programming introduced some challenge, particularly for those less familiar with it, but the overall course structure allowed for a self-organized learning and exploration.   

On the other hand, there seemed to be a bit of a disconnect between the students and their expectations of the course. We believe it could be beneficial to either lower the expectations in terms of programming competencies or provide a more detailed course description where a certain level of programming experience is listed as a suggested requirement. This could potentially help align the expectations on both sides and ensure a smoother overall experience.
