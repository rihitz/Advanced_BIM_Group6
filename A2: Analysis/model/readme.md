As instructed, the DTU Skylab IFC model has not been uploaded to this repository.  
The main.py script has been built and tested on "LLYN - STRU.ifc", which is the structural element model of the Skylab.

For script to run as intended, the following folder hierarchy must be implemented:  

main folder  
├── main.py  
├── model  
│   ├── LLYN - STRU.ifc.ifc
