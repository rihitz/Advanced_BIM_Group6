As instructed, the DTU Skylab IFC model has not been uploaded to this repository.  
The main.py script has been built and tested on "LLYN - STRU.ifc", which is the structural element model of the Skylab.  

To ensure the script runs as intended, please set up the following folder hierarchy (alternatively download the entire *A3: OpenBIM Change* folder):

    1. Create a 'Root' folder (if it doesn't exist).
    
    2. Inside the 'Root' folder, create the necessary subfolders in the following structure:
    
    Root
        model
            LLYN - STRU.ifc.ifc
        output
        main.py
