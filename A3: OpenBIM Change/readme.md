# Assignment 3 - Group 6

To ensure the script runs as intended, please set up the following folder hierarchy (alternatively download the entire *A2: Analysis* folder):

    1. Create a 'Root' folder (if it doesn't exist).
    
    2. Inside the 'Root' folder, create the necessary subfolders in the following structure:
    
    Root
        model
            LLYN - STRU.ifc
        output
        main.py


## Use case:
The BIM tool created for this task is best utilized alongside the one developed in Assignment 2. Its main function is to improve the provided IFC model by adding properties commonly found in an architectural IFC model rather than a structural one.  
The primary use case for this BIM tool is cost estimation, with a specific focus on structural elements - columns, load bearing walls, beams and slabs. The main objective of this tool is to streamline the process of precise quantity takeoffs, provided that an IFC model of an appropriate development level is available. This tool aims to improve the decision making and accuracy in cost estimation for construction projects.

## Who is the use case for?  
This tool can be used by all stakeholders involved in construction projects, especially those interested in the structural aspects. Designers can quickly compare various design concepts in terms of projected expenses, facilitating quick and informed decision making. Contractors, on the other hand, can efficiently estimate material costs for any given project. Furthermore, this tool has the potential to contribute in Life Cycle Assessment analysis.
