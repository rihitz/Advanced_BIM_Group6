To ensure the script runs as intended, please set up the following folder hierarchy (alternatively download the entire *A2: Analysis* folder):

    1. Create a 'Root' folder (if it doesn't exist).
    
    2. Inside the 'Root' folder, create the necessary subfolders in the following structure:
    
    Root
        model
            LLYN - STRU.ifc
        output
        main.py


## Use case:
The primary use case for this BIM tool is cost estimation, with a specific focus on structural elements - columns, load bearing walls, beams and slabs. The main objective of this tool is to streamline the process of precise quantity takeoffs, provided that an IFC model of an appropriate development level is available. This tool aims to improve the decision making and accuracy in cost estimation for construction projects.
